        <p>The Ndebele people of South Africa are part of the larger Nguni ethnic group and are known for their rich cultural heritage, distinctive art, and vibrant beadwork. They primarily live in the provinces of Mpumalanga, Limpopo, and parts of Gauteng.</p>

        <p>The South African Ndebele trace their origins to the 17th century, when a group of Nguni-speaking people broke away from the larger Zulu or Nguni communities and settled inland. Under leaders such as Musi, the Ndebele established their own identity and traditions.</p>

        <p>There are two main Ndebele groups in South Africa:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Southern Ndebele (isiNdebele)</strong>: Mainly found in Mpumalanga and Gauteng</li>
            <li><strong>Northern Ndebele (Matabele)</strong>: Mostly located in Zimbabwe, originally a breakaway group under Mzilikazi in the 19th century.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Ndebele are most famous for their brightly painted homes, often decorated by women using geometric patterns and vivid colors. These paintings carry cultural and social meaning.</p>

        <p>Culturally, the Ndebele have strong traditions involving initiation rites, traditional dress, and oral storytelling. Women are known for wearing beaded aprons and neck rings, especially during ceremonies.</p>

        <p>Today, the Ndebele continue to preserve their culture while also participating in modern South African society. Their art and fashion have gained international recognition, especially through iconic figures like Dr. Esther Mahlangu, a world-renowned Ndebele artist.</p>
